# Smallmouth Bass Long-term Changepoint Analysis
Detmer et al., in review @ the Journal of Applied Ecology

## Study framework 
Little Moose Lake is the site of a longterm smallmouth bass removal project. The fish community within this lake has been monitored for the last two decades. The goal of this analysis is to examin long-term trends in catch per unit effort (CPUE) and size of the fish community in response to that bass removal.

This is primarily conducted through the use of a changepoint analysis through the package `ecp` and a zero-inflated regression through the package `pscl`.
